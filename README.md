More details about the project [here](https://github.com/delco97/Checkers/blob/master/Doc/DelCortoAndrea(Matr.561446)_Dama_20201015_ver3.0/relazioneDama_DelCorto.docx).

Checkers is a traditional board game for two players. The word "checkers" comes from the Latin "domina" and indicates the "sovereign piece" and, by extension, the entire game.

There are different rules of the game, mainly national, given that in almost all countries, over time, checkers have taken on their own, albeit similar, rules. The characteristics that all types of checkers have in common are that they are a strategy board game, during which two players move their respective pieces (pawns and checkers) on a support, called a board, which consists of 64 boxes or 100 or 144 squares, half dark and half light, and capture the opposing pieces by "climbing over" them.

This project aims to create a program that allows you to play checkers according to the rules of Italian checkers in one of the following ways:
1. Human account human
2. Human versus AI.
3. AI versus AI.
